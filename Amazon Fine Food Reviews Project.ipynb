    "__CONTEXT:__\n",
    "\n",
    ">__Amazon Fine Food Reviews  :__ This dataset consists of half a million Amazon food reviews and was originally published by SNAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some interesting avenues of exploration on it include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- what does the product-reviewer graph look like?\n",
    "- what words tend to indicate positive and negative reviews?\n",
    "- what types of food products get reviewed the most?\n",
    "- how does review score distribution vary across reviewers?\n",
    "- what makes a review helpful? \n",
    "\n",
    "__PROJECT OBJECTIVE:__ Build a model that will help to identify the scoring of the food review given by the reviews and to classify whether the review is Positive or Negative review \n",
    "\n",
    "__Steps to the project:__\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Load the dataset:__\n",
    "- Import data and Explore shape and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Data cleansing:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing value treatment \n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert categorical attributes to continuous using relevant functional knowledge \n",
    "\n",
    "- Drop attribute/s if required using relevant functional knowledge \n",
    "\n",
    "- Automate all the above steps\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Data analysis & visualisation:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform detailed statistical analysis on the data. \n",
    "â€¢\n",
    "- Perform a detailed univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis with appropriate detailed comments after each analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "__4. Data pre-processing:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Segregate predictors vs target attributes \n",
    "\n",
    "- Check for target balancing and fix it if found imbalanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform train-test split. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Check if the train and test data have similar statistical characteristics when compared with original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "__5. Model training, testing and tuning:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train and test all ensemble models taught in the learning module. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggestion: Use standard ensembles available. Also you can design your own ensemble technique using weak classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Display the classification accuracies for train and test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply all the possible tuning techniques to train the best model for the given data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggestion: Use all possible hyper parameter combinations to extract the best accuracies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Display and compare all the models designed with their train and test accuracies. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the final best trained model along with your detailed comments for selecting this model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Pickle the selected model for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "__6. GUI development:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design a clickable web service application. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This application should allow the user to input all future values and on a click use these values on the trained model above to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It should display the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "__7. Conclusion and improvisation:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your conclusion on the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Detailed suggestions or improvements or on quality, quantity, variety, velocity, veracity etc. on the data points perform a better data analysis in future.\n",
